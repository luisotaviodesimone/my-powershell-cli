# My Powershell CLI

## Introduction

This is my powershell cli made to automate some processes made by me. Feel free to suggest some new functionalities 🙂

## Getting started

This cli is made to be used alongside my [.files](https://github.com/luisotaviodesimone/.files). That sad, some functionalities might not work without some tools that are installed there and its shell configuration.

Enjoy! 👨‍💻👍
