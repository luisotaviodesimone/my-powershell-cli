# My Powershell CLI

## Introduction

This is my powershell cli made to automate some processes made by me. Feel free to suggest some new functionalities 🙂

## Getting started

This cli is made to be used alongside my [.files](https://github.com/luisotaviodesimone/.files). That sad, some functionalities might not work without some tools that are installed there and its shell configuration.

## Notes

- To use the `lods git <context>` command you first need to create a new file that you fill similarly to the `sensible-info.example.json` but with your own sensible info

Enjoy! 👨‍💻👍
